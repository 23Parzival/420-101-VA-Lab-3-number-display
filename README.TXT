### Answers to Lab III, part I:

# Part I

1. Screenshots of drawings in repository. A class diagram shows the superclass 
   and subclass and an object diagram shows the objects created, the one lab class 
   object and the three student objects that are enrolled in it. A class diagram also 
   shows what is in the actual files, it is persistent. Object diagrams shows what is running
   at the moment.

2. If a class is added. A class will be added and its relashionship with the others
   can be changed. The diagram will simply display another class.

3. If a new object is created, a new object will be shown in the diagram.

4. `private Instructor tutor;`

5. limit is 24 and value is 0. 

8. No, the second one doesn't change it because it is above the limit. After setting
   the value to 10 and doing getValue, it returns 3 because 10 was over the limit and was ignored.

9. It will show zero because it reached the limit and will reset. 

10. Non-static method, cannot be called from static context.

11. .class expected. You have to remove the int in order for there to not be an error.

12. The difference is that now if you input the limit it will work 

13. 0

14. Anything from 0 to infinity.

15. ! false , (34 != 33) && ! false

16. `boolean result = (a == false) && (b == false);`

17. `boolean result = (a && !b) || (!a && b);`
    or `boolean result = a ^ b;`

18. Not exaclty, it assumes that the limit inputted is a two digit number, 
    when the limit is set to 1000 and 100 is inputed, it will return 100.

19. in the first example it is put in quotation marks, in the second it is just the number.

20. Prediction: 12cat and cat39. Results: the same.
